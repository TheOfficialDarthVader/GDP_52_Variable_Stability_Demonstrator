# GDP_52_Variable_Stability_Demonstrator
Contains the technical outputs of the GDP 52 Variable Stability Demonstrator project

## Certification
For the project to fly on the Scout it must be certified by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA).
The `certification_documentation` folder contains two documents:
- `LAA MOD 2.pdf`
- `LAA MOD 3.pdf`

Which are the two forms sent to the LAA for the project to be approved.

## Aerodynamics and Flight Dynamics
The aerodynamics and flight dynamics work is contained in the following folders:
- `drag_audit`
- `flight_dynamics_model`
- `full_system_simulink_model`
- `stick_force_model`

## CAD Models
The CAD created as part of this project is in the `cad` folder.
The assembly file `Final_CAD_Assembly.SLDASM` is the full assembly of all the subsystems.
The CAD is broken into the subfolders:
- `control_panel_cad`
- `interior_cad`
- `servo_rack_cad`

## Software
The software for the project is available externally at: https://github.com/danns99/GDP-Arduino.
